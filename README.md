# Teaching by Mistakes – Reasoning-First Electronics Tutor

This project was built as part of the **Google Tunix Hackathon on Kaggle**.

## 📌 Overview
Teaching by Mistakes is a reasoning-first AI tutor designed to help students learn core **Electronics fundamentals** through step-by-step explanations instead of only final answers.

## 🧠 Core Idea
Many students struggle due to incorrect reasoning patterns.  
This project trains a model using:
- Correct reasoning steps
- Common student mistakes
- Clear explanations and final answers

The goal is to improve conceptual understanding, not rote learning.

## ⚙️ Topics Covered
- Ohm’s Law
- Electrical Power
- Series and Parallel Circuits
- Diode Forward Bias
- Logic Gates (AND, OR)

## 🛠️ Technology Used
- Python
- Kaggle Notebooks
- Google Tunix-style reasoning format
- Gemma-based reasoning model (simulation)

## 📊 Dataset Structure
Each training example contains:
- Question
- Concept
- Common Mistake
- Correct Step-by-Step Reasoning
- Final Answer

## 🎯 Outcome
The model behaves like a tutor:
- Explains concepts clearly
- Identifies common mistakes
- Guides students step by step
